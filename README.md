#  lambdalisp 

Welcome to my langauge. 

What do: 
- extends C programs (forms top layer on C standard functions (not done))
- can be used to make logic systems, and other paradigms (via first order functions)
- written to compile almost anywhere (made using C99)

Motivation:
- I wanted to try making a language.
- I find that C, fundamentally does not have clean lexical scope or first order functions.
- I think of lisp more as a mathematical concept, than a programming language. It is a list processing API.
- First order functions make everything else possible. (logics, modern algebras, etc..)

Inspiration:
- chicken scheme
- picolisp
